# QBelMan
QBelMan is a repository to simulate several algorithms for queueing bandit problems, like Thompson sampling (ThS), UCB, BelMan, QBelMan, Q-UCB, and Q-ThS. The queueing bandit problem tries to match the queues and servers, with unknown arrival and service rates, in order to achive minimum queue length in hold.
